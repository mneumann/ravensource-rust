Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Some of its features:

  - zero-cost abstractions
  - move semantics
  - guaranteed memory safety
  - threads without data races
  - trait-based generics
  - pattern matching
  - type inference
  - minimal runtime
  - efficient C bindings
